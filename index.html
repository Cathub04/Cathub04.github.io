		<div class="col2"><p id="txt1" onmouseout="read1()">The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand.The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.</p></div>
		<div class="col2"><p id="txt2" onmouseout="read2()">Three main types of modern guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar); the steel-string acoustic guitar or electric guitar; and the Hawaiian guitar (played across the player's lap). Electric guitars, first patented in 1937, use a pickup and amplifier that made the instrument loud enough to be heard, but also enabled the manufacturing of guitars with a solid block of wood that need no resonant chamber. A wide array of electronic effects units became possible including reverb and distortion.</p></div>
